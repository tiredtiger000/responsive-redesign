        <h1> Responsive Redesign Assignment </h1>
        <p> We were given the task to redesign a single website and improve it so that its usability is more efficient. This assignment allowed us to 
            practice the workflow of redesigning a website, as well as to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface. 
            I chose to redesign <a href="http://www.avoncinema.com/">Avon Cinema's Original Webiste</a>. <br/>
            <u>Description:</u> Avon Cinema is a movie theatre website, allowing
            users to be able to purchase tickets and learn more about the cinema (location, social medias, store, e.t.c..)
        </p>

        <h2>PART 1 - Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
        <h3> Picking a Web Page </h3>
        <p>
            I chose to redesign <a href="http://www.avoncinema.com/">Avon Cinema's Original Webiste</a> because it a very simple website that also had a few issues with usability. 
            I thought that I was going to be able to make substantial improvements to this website. Avon Cinema is a small business located on Thayer Street that I'm sure many Brown students have passed by when walking on Thayer!
        </p>
        <h3>Finding Problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Usability (including efficiency)
                <ul>
                    <li> For frequent users of this website, it would make the page more efficient if there were certain shortcuts that are frequently 
                        visited by these groups of users. For example, to buy an admission ticket, one would need to scroll down to the admissions 
                        section on the homepage and click on a link that links to a PayPal site. It would be more efficient to make that into a shortcut 
                        at the beginning of the homepage or make it an option at the top of the navigation bar. Scrolling down to a specific part of a page 
                        can be difficult to not only remember but also easy to miss. </li>
                    <li>A minor usability issue is the fact that the homepage has a lot of empty space on the right side and the navigation menu bar at the 
                        top is not evenly spaced horizontally so it looks quite awkward on desktop view. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Learnability - For a first-time user, this website is quite hard to navigate through, thus, making it difficult for the user to 
                efficiently learn how the website works. For first-time users, it would be multiple repetitions of experimenting with what each feature 
                does or does not do. 
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, the navigation menu bar at the top of the homepage does not have any indication that it is clickable or that they 
                        are buttons that will navigate you to a different page. Typically a contrast in color or geometric indication that sets one tab 
                        apart from the others would be placed to show which tab the user is currently on and that the other tabs are also available to 
                        click through and view. However, because of the way it is listed in the same style, it’s difficult to discern that. 
                    </li>
                    <li>In addition to the top navigation bar, the AVON front image showing the movie titles is also apparently a button that will take 
                        you to another screen that shows the trailers. Users would not be able to figure this out unless they find it by chance either 
                        by hovering the mouse all over the screen or clicking the image perchance. There are many other issues that pertain to the 
                        learnability of the website which will be addressed and improved in later parts of this assignment. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Another learnability issue is that there are some buttons that will navigate to a separate page. Those buttons are designed so 
                        that it has a white shadowed border around the button to indicate that it is clickable; however, there are other icons with a 
                        similar white border but is not a button nor is it clickable. This can be confusing to first-time users. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Overall, there are just way too many interactive elements trying to be conveyed on a single image. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Memorability - I feel that memorability can also pose some difficulties to users even after they’ve experienced interacting with the 
                website interface and have gotten used to it. Because the layout of the website is not well structured and organized, it may be difficult 
                for returning users to remember the functionalities of the website. 
                <ul>
                    <li> For example, as mentioned before with the front image of AVON on the homepage of the website, there’s nothing that indicates 
                        that it is clickable. To add to that, only part of the image is clickable, and not the entire image itself, so it also incidentally 
                        makes it difficult to recall that ability.
                    </li>
                    <li> Another problem pertaining to the memorability of the website is that there is some information on the homepage that is included 
                        in the top bar and some information that is not included in the top bar. For example, when one scrolls down on the homepage, there 
                        is another section that talks about the movies that the theater is currently playing. When clicked, it navigates to the “Now Playing” 
                        page, the same page that the “Now Playing” at the top selection bar. However, information about the directions to the theater or 
                        renting out the theater is only on the homepage and not indicated at the top bar. This is a fine detail that is hard to remember 
                        even for a user who has visited the page before.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Some problems that WebAIM WAVE detected are that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> There are many missing alternative texts to images, linked images, and spacer images
                <ul>
                    <li>I agree with these problems detected</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> There are contrast errors
                <ul>
                    <li> I don’t agree with these problems. There is a pretty clear contrast in color for the social medias logos and the background of the page. 
                        I am able to easily identify the logos and icons from the rest of the page. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                No heading structure
                <ul>
                    <li>I agree with this problem. At the tome of the homepage of the website, there isn’t a clear heading. There’s only a navigation 
                        menu bar and a small AVON icon at the top left. In other words, there isn't a clear indication as to what the website is. If a user
                        were to go into this website without knowing its a cinema website, it would be hard to identify without having the heading (AVON Cinema)
                        super clear.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
